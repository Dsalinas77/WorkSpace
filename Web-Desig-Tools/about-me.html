        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>A little about me I am 29 years old and a single father of two kids. One boy  and one girl Gabriel is nine years old and Josephine is five years old. I work full time during the day and in the evening I have my chiildren. A year ago I decided to go back to scholl and get a degree so i can get a better job, my orginal goal was to be a sonographer. I found out it wasnt for me so I switched my course of study to Web Devolpoment. i chose this degree planbecause I enjoy being on the computer and I figured it can get me out of manuel labor jobs. My current plan is get my associates Web Devolpoment then get a Bachelors in Softerware Develpment.  </p>
